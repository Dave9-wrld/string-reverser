# 🔄 String Reverser (Collaborative Programming Project)

A simple web application that reverses user-input text.  
This project was built as a **collaborative programming exercise using GitHub**, with clear separation of frontend and backend responsibilities.

---

##  Project Overview

The application allows a user to:
1. Enter a string of text
2. Send the text to a Python backend
3. Receive and display the reversed string instantly

The project demonstrates:
- Frontend–backend communication
- Basic API design
- Collaborative development workflow

##  Team Contributions

### David 
- Designed the **user interface**
- Implemented **HTML and CSS**

### Bernard
- Implemented **JavaScript logic**
- Built the **Python backend using Flask**
- Handled frontend–backend integration

---

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Page structure  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – Client-side logic and API requests  
- **Python (Flask)** – Backend logic and routing  

---

##  How It Works

1. The user enters text into the input field.
2. JavaScript sends the text to the backend using a POST request.
3. The Flask backend reverses the string using Python slicing.
4. The reversed string is returned as JSON.
5. The frontend displays the result dynamically.
